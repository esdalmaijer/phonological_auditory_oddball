PREPARATION
-----------

1. Make sure that the participant is prepped with all necessary
   electrodes (2 VEOG, 2 HEOG, 1 cheek electrode for the ground,
   2 ECG one on each wrist, 2 on the right hand), and the HCI
   lines to track the head in the MEG scanner.
2. Make sure that the participant has earplugs.
3. Make sure that the display is turned on, and positioned in
   front of the participant (on the marked position).
4. MAKE SURE THE TRIGGER BOX IS SET TO "NI CARD"! You can find
   this box on the stimulus computer, and it has a switch and
   two options: "NI Card" and "PRL Port". We need it to be
   switched to the "NI Card" position.



WORMS TASK
----------

1. Open the folder E:\RED_Edwin\gotWorms_github\gotWorms
2. Go to the Start Menu, then select "All Programs" => Anaconda2
   => Anaconda Prompt
3. This should open a small black window with white text.
4. In the window, type the following command, and hit Enter:
    `cd /d "E:\RED_Edwin\gotWorms_github\gotWorms"`
5. In the same window, type the following command, and hit Enter:
    `python "experiment_v1.py"`
6. Now follow the instructions in the window.


ODDBALL TASK
------------

1. Open the folder E:\RED_Edwin\phonological_auditory_oddball
2. Go to the Start Menu, then select "All Programs" => Anaconda2
   => Anaconda Prompt
3. This should open a small black window with white text.
4. In the window, type the following command, and hit Enter:
    `cd /d "E:\RED_Edwin\phonological_auditory_oddball"`
5. In the same window, type the following command, and hit Enter:
    `python "oddball_experiment.py"`
6. Now follow the instructions in the window.


RESTING STATE
-------------

1. Turn off the display.
2. Tell the participant "Please close your eyes. Try not to think
   of anything in particular, and let your mind wander."
3. Record for 10 minutes.
